<h1>Sheridan's Design Document</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of my website is to provide an introduction to me. I want this site to help me create a distinct personal brand and showcase my work and capabilities. My goal for this site is to create a distinct brand for myself and present who I am in a professional, organized manner. I also want to get all of my work in one place and connect with people who enjoy my work. I study graphic design in University Missouri's strategic communications program in the Missouri School of Journalism and have a variety of past projects I'd like to showcase. People would visit my website to collaborate with me or follow my work, buy the work I have for sale or see what recent projects I've been working on. I want to connect with future employers, potential freelance clients, consumers who want to purchase my work, friends/family and anyone else who wants to follow my work. Hopefully, they will gain interest in me and want to contact me to network, follow my work or purchase my work for sale.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>One use case would be a friend or family member visiting my website. Since I've moved away for college, my family and friends miss me and constantly want to know what I'm up to and what type of work I've been doing in my classes and at my job. Jacqui Young, for example, is my aunt and during our interview said that the website would be important/useful to her to "see what Sher's doing and keep in touch with her." My parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins would all likely check back on my website frequently (I have a big family). In this case, they would likely read the description about me on the home page to see what I've been up to, then they would click "Work" to look at the recent images I have created. My family may make a big portion of the purchases on my site as well, especially when I'm starting out, as it likely will take a while for me to network and build a client base.</p>

<p>Another use case would be a coworker or someone who would like to reach out to me for networking purposes. Alice Yanello, for example, is a recruiter at Express and has reached out to me in the past asking for help designing a website on SharePoint for her team. She might start on the homepage, click on "Work" and browse my current work. Once she sees if my web design skills align with what she is looking for, she'll hopefully click the "Contact" form to reach out to me based on my contact preferences and I'll work with her to provide my freelance web design services.</p>

<p>Another use case would be someone who produces work of their own and would like to collaborate with me. Joshua Fletshock, for example, told me in the interview that I conducted with him that he would check back to see my work and get ideas for the work he produces. He may start at my homepage, read the description section about me, click on "Work," then browse my current work. To get in touch with me about collaborating in the future, he might click the "Contact" section or just click the email hyperlink at the bottom of my page.</p>

<h2>Design Concept</h2>

<p>My target audience will consist of my peers who would like to collaborate, friends/family, coworkers, future employers and anyone else interested in graphic design/following my work.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ages:</li>
<p>My users will fall into two different groups, by both demographic and psychographic qualities. The first group will be ages of my peers, in the age range of 18-24. The second age group will represent family (parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles) and future employers who fall in the age range of 45-70. I know this is a large age demographic to select, but this will cover anyone who has years of experience in the industry who could be a future employer and all of my older relatives.</p>
    <li>Gender:</li>
<p>However my audience identifies is none of my concern, I will not be targeting a specific gender :)</p>
    <li>Where they would live:</li>
<p>My primary target will be Denver, Colorado. ALl of the family I am targeting lives in Colorado and this is also the area I'm also most interested in connecting with future employers from this area. Geographics will otherwise be a moving target in the US, as my peers from school will be moving all around the country and I'm also interested in connecting with potential employers located anywhere in the US. Specific locations I'm interested in include New York, California, Chicago, Portland and Boulder. I'd like to keep this open because I want to connect with anyone interested in following or buying my work regardless of where they may be located (although if they want to buy my work I may not be able to ship outside of the US).</p> 	
    <li>What they do for a living/hobbies:</li>
<p>A large portion of my users in the age range of 18-24 will be in the process of moving, finishing school, getting new jobs and going through large life transitions. I will try to tailor my content partially to their "on the go" lifestyle. This group will likely enjoy browsing creative content on various platforms online, from Pinterest to Instagram. This group is driven by passion and experience and will go out of their way to find inspiration which I will hopefully provide them.</p>
<p>The older demographic portion of my users will likely have families and their interests will be tailored to maintaining a satisfying work-life balance. My target will enjoy time with family, finding success at work, the little things and are interested in planning vacations and experiences when they have the means. I will help them save time on difficult tasks like designing a website for their company or making their loved ones feel special with handmade calligraphy, posters, cards, graphics, etc. Future employers/freelance clients are extremely busy with work and family and are interested in finding talent that can help with their business. They will be looking for a quick, straightforward presentation of my abilities that showcases all of my creativity and demonstrates how I can add value to their business.</p>
    <li>Internet usage/computer skills:</li>
<p>My users aged 18-24 grew up with technology, always have an iPhone in hand and are constantly on their laptops for work and school. They will find my website easy to navigate. The other group of my users aged 45-70 are acclamated to newer technology but also find themselves making small mistakes like accidentally typing double spaces because they learned to type on a typewriter. This is why I want to keep my navigation simple and self-explanatory, to cater to their need to locate the information quickly with an extremely user-friendly web environment.</p>
    <li>Prior knowledge or experience they may have:</li>
<p>The first group of my users will likely have a lot of prior experience and vested interest in graphic design. Whether or not they create graphics themselves, if they find themselves on my site they are at the very least interested in looking at them. For this group, the purpose of this site may vary from finding personal inspiration to purchasing a gift or even decorating their rooms/offices with my work. Future employers will obvioulsy have the most experience in this area, and will be looking for a high level of understanding of graphic design on my part. My challenge is to cater my content both to this group of people and to family, friends and others who are not as familiar with graphic design and artwork but would like to see what I'm up to or purchase something.</p>
  </ul>

<h2>Reference Websites</h2>

<p><a href="http://jessieren.com/">Jessie Ren</a></p>
<p>Jessie Ren's webpage has a lot of interactive functionality which plays to her strengths as a web designer and graphic artist, but the webpage itself is more difficult to use and you can tell that she would benefit from simplifying her website because she currently has placeholders where she is working on new content. I really like the simple layout of her site, it is very easy to use and follow.</p>
<p><a href="http://helenwbentley.com/">Helen W. Bentley</a></p>
<p>I really admire this website for how straightforward it is to get to the content and for the simple layout. But unlike the other website, I think Bentley could benefit from some interactivity on her site. She could also benefit from including some white space and simplifying the style of her website so the content looks less crowded.</p>
<p><a href="http://emelynbaker.com/">Emelyn Baker</a></p>
<p>I think of all the other sites I have looked at this is my favorite. I really like how she utilized the homepage to provide an introduction to herself and I think doing something similar on my webpage will help me successfully reach my target audience. Unlike my site, her site intends for the user to continue scrolling to navigate through her content, although I like this I think my users will find it easier to click on the navigation to get through my site instead. I may play around with putting some of my work on my homepage and see how this looks/how easy it is for users to navigate.</p>
<p><a href="http://tobiasahlin.com/">Tobi Asahlin</a></p>
<p>This website is very unique becuase it doesn't include any navigation at all! I don't think I like this becuase there is no way for the users to return to the top of the page. In my use cases, I've found that users would like to have an easy to follow way of looing at the work, and I don't think this can be achieved without clickable navigation items. On the other hand, I love the way this website is laid out and really enjoyed scrolling through it. I like the blocks of color and links to different pages and I think I will utilize similar visual ideas on my website.</p>
<p><a href="https://roomfive.net/">Andrew Couldwell</a></p>
<p>I absolutely love this website. I find it so easy to navigate and extremely simple, which through my use cases I've found is extremely important. I will utilize a very similar layout with equally sized images laid out on the page with captions included. The only thing that I don't find appealing is that the text on the website is extremely large and you have to scroll past the page fold to see any images. Through my research I've found that users don't scroll past the page fold, particularly if they are not as acclamated to technology. I want to include an image on the home page so that it is visually enticing and encourages users to go further. This gave me the idea to include a call to action on my homepage but I will pair this with an image instead of only including text.</p>

<h2>Presentation Information</h2>

<p>Content Synopsis: The specific content I want to include on this site is clickable image thumnbails that link to pages with videos and photos of my work. Each of these will include a brief description of the concept and why I created it. I intend to present the content on my site in a minimalist manner, with bold background colors but an extremely simple, easy-to-follow layout that helps to present who I am and my capabilities as a graphic designer.</p>

<p>Text Outline of Website Organization:</p>

<p>Home - A static homepage with an image and brief intro text.</p>
    <p> >> Topic 1 - My work</p>
    <p>Here I will include clickable thumbnail images of my work.</p>
        <p> >> Topic 1a - Matt Healy poster</p>
        <p>This subsection will feature a poster I created of Matt Healy.</p>
        <p> >> Topic 1b - Hulu campaign</p>
        <p>Here I will feature print ads and a banner ad video I created for a class assignment on a Hulu campaign.</p>
        <p> >> Topic 1c - We Sip Air Campaign</p>
        <p>Here I will feature print ads and an animated video prototype of a parallax scrolling website. This campaign was for the Alpine Shop, a business I decided to focus on for a semester as a class assignment.</p>
    
    
    <p> >> Topic 2 - Contact Me</p>
    <p>This tab will not have any subsections. There will be a brief description of who I am and ways to contact me. I will include a contact form feature if this is possible.</p>

<p>Wire Frame of Website Organization:</p>
    <a href="https://wireframe.cc/azX7pz">Home</a>
    <a href="https://wireframe.cc/NlB0H2">Work</a>
    <a href="https://wireframe.cc/mjaEsJ">Contact</a>

<p>Note: The color palette I have chosen is not used in my wireframe models, see description for more information on my color choices.</p>
    
<p>Rationale of Organization</p>
<p>This website will be well organized and easy to to navigate because I will keep it extremely simple. I will support my target audience with an easy-to-navigate site. To start, I will only include three navigation elements. I will be very conscious of the information I include under the page fold, and I will keep plenty of white space on the page. The clickable elements will be laid out in a visually appealing way with lots of padding around each thumbnail. The information will be organized in this manner becuase I want the user to do three things. (1) Learn about me on the home page. (2) View my featured content on the work page. (3) Contact me if they are interested in buying my work, collaborating, or subscribing.</p>

<p>Media</p>
<p>I will use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Videos</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<p>I will acquire and develop the media completely on my own. Everything I have created is my own work with images I have rights to. If not, I have the sources cited. I will include this media to showcase my work, this is the most vital part of my site in which the user will develop an opinion of me and decide whether or not to click to the content section of the page.</p>
    
<p>Color Palette</p>

<p>I have chosen this color palette not only because purple is my favorite color, but also because I really enjoy the essence it communicates and the contrast it provides against white text. I have used class resources to determine that I need to be careful as this can appeaer artificial, but I will use caution to create a minimalist design to avoid the site appearing artificial.</p>
