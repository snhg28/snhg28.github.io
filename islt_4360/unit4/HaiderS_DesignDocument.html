<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of my website is to provide an introduction to me. I want this site to help me create a distinct personal brand and showcase my work and capabilities. My goal for this site is to create a distinct brand for myself and present who I am in a professional, organized manner. I also want to get all of my work in one place and connect with people who enjoy my work. I study graphic design in University Missouri's strategic communications program in the Missouri School of Journalism and have a variety of past projects I'd like to showcase. People would visit my website to collaborate with me or follow my work, buy the work I have for sale or see what recent projects I've been working on. I want to connect with future employers, potential freelance clients, consumers who want to purchase my work, friends/family and anyone else who wants to follow my work. Hopefully, they will gain interest in me and want to contact me to network, follow my work or purchase my work for sale.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>One use case would be a friend or family member visiting my website. Since I've moved away for college, my family and friends miss me and constantly want to know what I'm up to and what type of work I've been doing in my classes and at my job. Jacqui Young, for example, is my aunt and during our interview said that the website would be important/useful to her to "see what Sher's doing and keep in touch with her." My parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins would all likely check back on my website frequently (I have a big family). In this case, they would likely read the description about me on the home page to see what I've been up to, then they would click "Work" to look at the recent images I have created. My family may make a big portion of the purchases on my site as well, especially when I'm starting out, as it likely will take a while for me to network and build a client base.</p>

<p>Another use case would be a coworker or someone who would like to reach out to me for networking purposes. Alice Yanello, for example, is a recruiter at Express and has reached out to me in the past asking for help designing a website on SharePoint for her team. She might start on the homepage, click on "Work" and browse my current work. Once she sees if my web design skills align with what she is looking for, she'll hopefully click the "Contact" form to reach out to me based on my contact preferences and I'll work with her to provide my freelance web design services.</p>

<p>Another use case would be someone who produces work of their own and would like to collaborate with me. Joshua Fletshock, for example, told me in the interview that I conducted with him that he would check back to see my work and get ideas for the work he produces. He may start at my homepage, read the description section about me, click on "Work," then browse my current work. To get in touch with me about collaborating in the future, he might click the "Contact" section or just click the email hyperlink at the bottom of my page.</p>

<h2>Design Concept</h2>

<p>My target audience will consist of my peers who would like to collaborate, friends/family, coworkers, future employers and anyone else interested in graphic design/following my work.</p>
