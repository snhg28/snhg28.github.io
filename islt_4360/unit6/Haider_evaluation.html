<h2>Evaluator Participants</h2>

<p>Andrew Franceschi</p>
<p>I know Andrew from work, we worked together during our summer internship and are both planning on working for Arrow Electronics next year starting after graduation in May. Andrew works in operations and oversees a lot of graphic content that pertains to technology and he also has a variety of experience working in the back end of websites with HTML. He evaluated my website using a Dell PC running Windows 10, Intel Core i7-865OU CPU @1.90 GHz on Front Motion Firefox.</p>

<p>Lauren Polanski</p>
<p>I met Kaitlyn in communications law, she has been an excellent networking connection for the past year. She is two years younger but I would argue more accomplished than I with graphic design, she has pursued a variety of freelance opportunities and I fully trust her experience and opinion of my work.</p>

<p>Alice Yanello</p>
<p>Alice Yanello is a recruitor for Express, we met through mutual connections at a dinner party and she has also been a great networking connection. Alice is planning to build a website for her branch and I am working with her to do so. She gave me extremely substantive feedback on my Design Document and asked to follow up with me on how it is going so I asked her to do the evaluation form as well.</p>

<h2>Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h2>

<p>Between my classmates and my evaluator participants, I got mostly good reviews of my website with some substantive critiques. I was critiqued that the white elements within my navigation were somewhat distracting and hard to read, this is consistent with the feedback I was given from my classmates and I will make an effort to change this for my final website. I was also told on two separate occasions that I left out the footer on two of my pages, I'm not sure how I missed this but I will be sure to fix this immediately. On my work page, I was given the feedback that the images are intriguing but their purpose is somewhat unclear. I understand, because I have seen these images through from ideation to implementation and know which are class assignments, campaigns or personal projects, but I need to make this information clear to my users. I was also informed that the border on my contact form intersects with the image on my contact page and I will fix this right away. One of my classmates recommended that I put the image in the header which I can't wait to try, I think this will help a lot.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>Yes, I believe my website did support all three of my use cases. These use cases included friends/family, future employers and other content creators/peers, all of who would utilize the site functionality to collaborate, buy/follow my work. The purpose of this site is to connect with these people and hopefully interest them in connecting with me, following my work/buying my work, or just getting ideas from me for their own work. Because I've had the opportunity for so many people to look at this prior to finishing my final project, I feel confident that I will support all these use cases in my final website as well. I think the only things I need to work on are providing more images with further descriptions to aid in the purpose of further describing the concepts I'm working with to get my viewers more interested and getting my contact form to work (I don't know how to set up a PHP form but I'm at least going to try -- no promises!).</p>

<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes to the Design</h2>

<p>I plan to change several elements of my website including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Footer</li>
    <p>Alice Yanello and one of my classmates (in our class discussion) both noted that I had left out a footer on two of my pages. I will include this with my reasoning being that people will need to see my information on each page to reach me easier and to provide credibility and professionalism to my site.</p>
    <li>Image description/add pages</li>
    <p>One of my classmates pointed out that the images were intriguing but she wanted to know more about them. I also received feedback from Alice and Andrew that they would like to learn more about my content and see more. This change will help me to reach more of my users in a more engaging way and will improve my site by making it easier to use and read.</p>
    <li>Put image in header/fix contact form border</li>
    <p>One of my classmates noted that my "icy stare" image intersects with the boarder on my contact form. I will attempt to resize this image so that it is not in the way to provide a more visually appealing experience for my users.</p>
    <li>Change navigation</li>
    <p>The biggest feedback I recevied through my evaluations and class discussion was about my navigation element. Both Andrew and the classmate that reviewed my site said that the text and white background makes the menu tougher to look at and use. I'm so happy that I've asked them to review because I previously didn't realize this was an issue, I plan to fix this and instead I will use heavier weighted text with a different color that allows for a lot of contrast. I hope to make my navigation more user friendly which will improve the site by allowing more users to (hopefully) click on the contact form!</p>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection on Your Evaluation Experience</h2>

<p>I found the most useful evaluation to be from classmates in our discussion board, through my personal observations and through my interview form. I found that the Evaluation form was tough for people to fill out and have the time to do (I sent to 10 people and only was able to get 3 to fill it out), whereas when I created a survey on Microsoft Forms people were a lot more willing to help because it wasn't as time consuming for them, and their responses were more substantive. In the evaluation form, it seemed like people were trying to rush through it. Not sure why a Word doc is more "intimidating" than a Microsoft Forms survey, but I'll be sure to keep this in mind when I'm doing research in the future.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of things that I didn't pick up myself, that giving people context (on my pictures for example) is the most important element of my site because my users would like to be walked through the content, a website is different than an art gallery where you need to explain the intended purpose of your website. I also learned that my attention to detail isn't as fine tuned as I thought, as I left out my footer on two pages, had an image intersecting with the border on my contact form and even had a grammatical error on my home page. I will work hard to fix these prior to submitting my final project. I learned that my classmates are by far the best resource, they know what the expectations of the project are and are more familiar with HTML than anyone else I have asked (perhaps I need to do some networking).</p>

<p>My different evaluators all brought various expertise to the table because they had different backgrounds. Andrew has a background with innovation, technology and HTML while Alice has a background in recruiting, user experience and psychology and Lauren has a journalistic background with graphic design.</p>
