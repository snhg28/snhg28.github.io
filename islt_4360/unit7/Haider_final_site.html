<h2>A little about me</h2>

<p>Hi, I’m Sher! I’m an aspiring graphic designer hailing from Colorado. A lot of people ask me why I moved to Missouri, and I’m not entirely sure either. I love Mizzou’s journalism school and it was easy to tell just how well it prepared me for the real world when I started out at Arrow Electronics in digital marketing last summer. This all started with my passion to create something from nothing, which took its first form in writing. I came to Mizzou for journalism because I love to color with the written word, and once I got into the strategic communications department I realized that I could do more than just that with the software I was learning: I could actually show people the pictures in my head. I’m basic in the sense that I love coffee, bubbles and cute puppies but what you have to know about me is my mind is always booming with new ideas. I’m always thinking, conceptualizing and processing the world around me and I’ll work harder than anyone to share my perception with the world. Graphic design and I are only celebrating our 2-year anniversary but it’s still my only true love, take a click around to see the romance for yourself.</p>
