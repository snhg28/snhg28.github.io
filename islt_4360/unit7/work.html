    <h2>About My Work</h2>
<p>Within my strategic communications journalistic curriculum, I have chosen art direction as my focus and have taken a variety of classes to prepare me for a career in graphic design. After taking Graphic Design I and II, Creative Portfolio, Illustrator Techniques, 3D Design for Advertising, and Graphic Design through the art school, I feel I have a set of amazing work to show future employers and other creatives who want to collaborate with me. Below are my absolute favorites - get excited! Click the "Contact" tab to let me know your thoughts.</p>

  <li><img src="image1.jpg" alt="Matt Healy Poster" width="444" height="288"> Matt Healy Poster </li>
  <p>This is by far my favorite project that I've ever done in my life. I am completely obsessed with Matt Healy and he was one of my first inspirations. I love his music, and I find his words very impactful. I think because of this wisdom he has a hard time making sense out of relationships, love and life. For people who can see the infinate complexities and possibilities in life, these simple things can be harder to grasp.</p>
  <p>"Lost My Head" is the name of one of my favorite songs on this EP, and in my earlier versions of this poster I had him breathing out the words "I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it" to symbolize the arduous creative process that starts with "Losing" your mind and how efforless the final articulation can seem to the untrained eye.</p>
  <p>I'm extremely interested in designing graphics within the music industry, so if you or anyone you know would like to collaborate with me, please hit the "Contact" button up to the left. :)</p>
  <li><img src="image2.jpg" alt="We Sip Air" width="436" height="288"> We Sip Air </li>
  <p>This photo always puts me at ease. For graphic design II, a class I took a couple semesters ago in the strategic communications art direction program at the Missouri School of Journalism, I chose the Alpine Shop as my client for the entire semester. I organized three separate campaigns for this local outdoor gear company in Columbia, Missouri.</p>
  <p>While I was envisioning the needs of the target audience for the Alpine Shop, I envisioned midwestern people who love the small town feel of Columbia, but likely want to set out on an adventure of their own. This element of "escape" took hold of my campaign, the concept being that you need the outdoors like you need air to breathe, or water to drink.
    The "We Sip Air" campaign is aimed at bringing consumers to the realization that the Alpine Shop is their escape; the equipment, expertise and recommendations they need can all be found here.</p>
    <li><img src="image3.jpg" alt="Bike In Midair" width="542" height="361"> Bike In Midair </li>
    <p>This photo is part of the second campaign I created for the Alpine Shop. This one, rather than addressing the consumers' desire to escape, pokes a bit of fun at the unprepared explorer. We've all been there before, you forgot a sock, your ski poles, or maybe even the bike itself?</p>
    <p>This campaign is a great way of letting the Alpine Shop's target audience know that they can laugh at themselves a little, and rather than struggle to make their adventure happen, they can come to the Alpine Shop to get more prepared instead. "What would you do without our equipment?"</p>
    <li><img src="image4.jpg" alt="Chevrolet Bolt EV" width="465" height="360">Own Your Electricity</li>
    <p>This is the first campaign I ever created and remains my favorite. This campaign is aimed at the YAYA audience, targeting 18-24 year-olds who are likely met with a great deal of uncertainty about what the future holds. As a creative, I wanted this campaign to resonate with those of us who know we have so much to offer but are still cultivating our skills and finding our way.</p>
    <p>Once you put your hands on the wheel, it's all you. Your story is unwritten, and in the Bolt EV your creative essense and who you are spills out through your fingertips into the world around you. You are safe, you are inherently worthy of this adventure and you can light up the world as you drive by.</p>

    <p>The copy reads:</p>
    <blockquote>"The Chevrolet Bolt EV will take you to your own world. Be alone with your thoughts, let your creative vision come to life. Bolt from 0-60 in 6.5 seconds. Let your energy spill from your fingertips onto the wheel and into the world around you. With 250 miles per charge, cultivate your unique journey without stopping. Surround yourself in it. Make it your own."</blockquote>

  <li><img src="image5.jpg" alt="Hulu Campaign" width="403" height="320"> Hulu Boomerang </li>
  <p>This campaign is another one of my favorite concepts, I created this working with my copywriter Nicole Newman in creative portfolio - a semester-long class in which I worked consistently through the creative process to make several impressive campaigns.</p>
  <p>The Hulu ad campaign is based around a consumer value that is very important to the target audience. The "next-day" viewing available on Hulu is equivalent to a boomerang in this context, your favorite shows and videos come straight back to you. This is a point of difference Hulu offers over most streaming services, in which you don't have to wait, wait, wait for a new season to come out and then binge watch it all in the next week (not like any of us have ever done this...).</p>
  
  <p>The copy reads:</p>
  <blockquote>"Missed last night's episode of Bachelor in Paradise? Don't worry about it. Hulu episodes are one-by-one so you don't have to wait an entire season to see if Chris gives Kendall the final rose. The day after it airs, Hulu brings your favorite shows right back to you." -Nicole Newman</blockquote>
