<p>Hello, welcome to my website! This website will serve as an introduction to me and my abilities as a graphic designer. The topic will be a showcase of all of my past work with a couple different sections. I'll include animated videos, creative advertising campaigns, print ads and other graphics I've created like the image above. I want to create a contact form or section dedicated to how to get in touch with me.</p>
