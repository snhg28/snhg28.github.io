   <h2>About My Site</h2>
   <p>Hello, welcome to my website! This website will serve as an introduction to me and my abilities as a graphic designer. I hope that future employers will want to visit the site to get an impression of my work. The topic will be a showcase of all of my past work with a couple different sections. People will be able to browse my work which will be organized and have a visually appealing layout. I'd also like to include a brief description for each campaign/photo.<br>I'll include:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Animated Videos</li>
     <li>Creative Advertising Campaigns</li>
     <li>Print Ads</li>  	
     <li>Contact Information</li>
     <li>Other Graphics and Creations :)</li>
   </ul>

  <p>My current portfolio has a nice layout of my content, but I'd like the site I'm creating to describe a little bit more about me and my processes. Here is an example of the content I'd like to create:</p> <a href="https://bigworldlittlesher.com/"> Click here to view my current portfolio.</a>
